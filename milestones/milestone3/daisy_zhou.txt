I really like how interesting debate project (from Jacky Chen-Chia Wu, Swapnil Ralhan, Tsung Han Tsai, David Spies) is.  There are a lot of different things going on in addition to the main debate feature, like comments and polls.  I was most excited about the poll after the debate, it seemed like a natural feature for them to have and it works very nicely.  I looked in their github repository and it looks like it's implemented as a regular model (votes).  Everything looks structured and organized and looks like it has room to grow.

The white board application caught my eye. They have developed their interface to large extent, and it looks almost ready for deployment. I has a feature for chat as well which we used as a group when probing the various applications. However, their use of Ruby and Rails is very limited. It is primarily a Javascript application mounted onto a small db. It isnt a large scale db application. though it severes its own purpose.

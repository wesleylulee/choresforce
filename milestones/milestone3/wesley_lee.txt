The white-board application has many cool features. In general,
the UI is very intuitive and easy to use. The entire application
also runs very smoothly. I'm not sure if this feature works cause
I couldn't test it with anyone else, but the feature that allows
you to chat while drawing something on the white board is really
cool. Upon looking at the github repository, I really like how 
elegant the database schema is. There are very few models but
it gets the job done.
